# foldseek-bindings

Simple interface to use `easy-search` from [foldseek](https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek) from the great people below

all credit for foldseek goes to them, this is just a python interface. 

The ideal implementation uses pybind and compiles their c++, but I'm too lazy and just called it via exec and read stdout. 

In other words, there is much room for improvement here.

## Running

First install the foldseek executable and make sure it's in your path as `foldseek`. 


Then import and use like

```py
from foldseek import easy_search

output = easy_search(
	query="test_examples/A.pdb",
	target="test_examples",
	out_format=["query", "target", "prob"],
)

print(output)
# >>> [['A.pdb', 'A.pdb', 1.0], 
# 	   ['A.pdb', 'B.pdb', 0.1494]]
```
